# Movie reviews aggregator
### Presentation Description/Overview
#### Problem
Before watching a movie many people look at reviews on various resources.  
An average person has several movie sources where he/she checks reviews.  
As a result, a person needs to visit each movie source,  
find a movie that user would like to read about  
and finally visit movie's review page.

Why all movies' reviews can be checked on a single movie source?

1. Movies are rated very differently on various platforms(IMDb, rotted tomatoes, etc)
   based on country, genre, typer  and more.
    * For example, a niche-genre or subgenre movie is better to check  
      on a special platform(eastern movies-kinopoisk, anime-mal, polish movies-filmweb.pl and more).
2. Any single movie source cannot provide full information/reviews on each movie.


#### Solution
A website that gathers reviews from most popular movie sources.  
The application provides brief information of searched movie and provides  
links to the chosen/favorite movie sources' review page.  
As a result, user can save time because all needed reviews are gathered in one place.
